Product Manual - Meet XL pages 7-10 have good info on States, Cycles, Counts, Times. Also Appendix A goes over the different Metrics

Production Time = Setup + Down + Run
In Count = Total Count
Job = Work Order
V1 vs V2
* V1 is the old version of the Vorne board
   * Data was in the interval_stream and timeline_stream tables
   * This had less built in reports and data viewing functionality but had more programs and customizability
* V2 is the new version (on 2.19 right now)
   * Data is in v2_xxxx tables
   * This is the data we are using
Device Key 
* Synonyms: Work station, machine, device
* A single device that work is being done on that the Vorne board is connected to
* May technically be made of multiple machines that is grouped into one but for data collection purposes we consider it as one device
* Example - Printing Press XL106G
   * Typically a Manufacturer with model and a unique identifier, but up to the client
Down time (v1 term)
* Synonyms: Unplanned Stop Time (v2 term)
* The device still has people there and is supposed to be running again eventually but is temporarily down or not producing
* Usually requires a reason scan so supervisor know why it is down
* Example 
   * Down - Ran out of Ink
   * Down - Press Broke
   * Down - Paper Jam
Setup Time (v1 term)
* Synonyms: Planned Stop Time (v2 term), Changeover
* The device is not running at full capacity, it’s getting set up to start running. Typically happens at the start of a job but can happen in the middle if they run of some raw material (like paper rolls for a printing press)
* Some devices are configured to automatically go into run after a certain run rate is achieved 
Standby Time (v1 term)
* Synonyms: Non Production Time, Not Scheduled Time (v2 term)
* The device is not scheduled to run. It’s a weekend or holiday
Run Time
* The device is running at a decent set rate
* Some devices can be configured to record running normally vs running slowly
Ideal Cycle Time
* The fastest possible time to run a cycle, assuming optimal conditions without any delays or inefficiencies
